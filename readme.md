# Purpose
We make you stronger, and then you make us stronger. So don't hesitate to share information with each other.

# Process
1. About how to play the presentation/seminar/workshop/experience sharing subject. (Below, call it is EXP)
	- Lightening talk in 30 min. Not strictly to restrict the time.
	- English-only.【Note_1】
	- If the topic has any repository for explain or example, please open a public repository on the Github. 【Note_2】
	- The EXP schedule will set in the morning on Monday or Friday.
2. The EXP topic does not restrict any subject and type. You could build a slideshow/ demo or blog. For instance:
	- design pattern. 【Note_3】
	- Leetcode, Algorithm or How to make the test more efficiency.
	- Your current product process, project, or side project.
	- Some exciting news in our fields.
	- Any issue or something you hope to share. So it means the topic not only limited from the technology.【Note_4】
4. After the EXP
	- We will take a pic. The host could use it in your blog or repository. 
	- I will build a public repository, and it includes every EXP. So each host, please add a link/ update the list after the EXP if you have.
5. Each host has one time to postpone his EXP. 

【Note_1】
- Please, we hope to help each other, and if you want, please recording as a video; maybe you are interested in your expression and could help you to make it better.
- Please do it if someone has correct any sentence in English within the process.

【Note_2】: About the repository, if you have
1. You could use any language with code(C/Python/Javascript). And the description could be made in Chinese or English.
2. Please, don't hesitate to click the STAR, thumb up, or any issues.

【Note_3】 
- Why I think the design pattern is helpable, because we all are developer, although we use different language, maybe you don't need to know about the CI or CD or frontend. But all of us need to learn the design patterns. Or some particular word in these fields. 

【Note_4】
- fitness
- travel
- English learning
- After reading a Book.
- Any experience you could share.
